# oakland-call-center

To get some first-hand experience with call center data, I decided to download the largest dataset I could find on the subject. I'll be doing some in-depth exploration on the data to find any relevant trends and create essential data visualizations. 

From there, I will see if the data can be used to make predictions about future calls and if it can provide insight on ways the experience can be improved to provide a better user experience.
